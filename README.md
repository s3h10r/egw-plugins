generators
----------

The generator 'sprites' is made with [code by Eric Davidson](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/how-to-create-generative-art-in-less-than-100-lines-of-code-d37f379859f).

The generator 'psychedelic' is the wonderfull code of ["Random (Psychedelic) Art, and a Pinch of Python" by Jeremy Kun](http://jeremykun.com/2012/01/01/random-psychedelic-art/).

The generator 'squares+circles' is heavily [inspired by Kevin Howbrook's Squares](https://medium.com/@kevinhowbrook/learning-python-and-being-creative-making-art-with-code-da02880e3738)

The generator 'mondrian' is an adoption of the  [Nifty Assigment](http://nifty.stanford.edu/) [Mondrian Art - Beautiful Recursion by Ben Stephenson](http://nifty.stanford.edu/2018/stephenson-mondrian-art/) (Stanford University)
